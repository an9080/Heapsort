# Heapsort
For this project we were asked to design a Thulathi heapsort algorithm and compare it with a binary heapsort regarding runtime and number of comparisons for each algorithm. We were able to complete this task by first implementing both algorithms in java code, then giving both algorithms identical arrays and comparing their efficiency. Finally, we plotted the binary and thulathi heapsorts to compare execution time vs array size using RStudio and R language.
